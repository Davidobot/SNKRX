Major:
 * items not saving
 * freezing iOS when tapping out?
 * frequent wake-up (battery issue)
 * The way I cause it is having one unit left on the shop, the shop is locked and it is level 1 the shop. Whenever I buy that last unit, close the game and reopen it the united still shows up as if I didn't buy it, but it still upgrades the unit on the snake, therefore duplicating that unit. If you want I can try different conditions (2 units on the shop, different levels, unlocked shop, just buying one unit, etc.)

Minor:
 * when saving and reloading, new units appear in shop w/o re-roll
