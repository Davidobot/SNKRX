* Change control strings
* Add advanced touchscreen controls (snake turns towards finger)
* fix saving on android
* maybe use love.window.getSafeArea() (requires offsetting coordinates)
* add second pause button to LHS of screen
* make sure buttons aren't sticky (when release touch, buttons remain highlighted: quick fix would be to set cursor position to 0,0 on touch release)
